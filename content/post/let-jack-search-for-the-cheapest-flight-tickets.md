Have you ever wondered how some people seem to get ridicuously cheap tickets? The cheapest ticket from Amsterdam to Mexico you are able to find is about 600 euro return but your friend tells you he bought one for 350? How annoying. So, you just have to scour the internet a little more. OR, you just let Jack do the heavy lifting!

<!--more-->

Recently, a friend of mine attended me to [this mailing list](https://jacksflightclub.com) that has gotten him amazing deals. Being my sceptic self, I told him I would try it out the free version first. Within a few weeks I was totally conviced. Jack has some powerful algorithms that scour the internet for tickets that are much cheaper than usual!

## How does it work?

Even though I have not been able to get a behind-the-scenes at Jack, I am sure they have some powerful web scrapers, search algorithms and analytics running to determine when and which flights can be bought at a mucnh cheaper than normal rate. Jacksflightclub describes their own service as

```
Jack’s Flight Club is a community of many people looking for one thing: getting to the destination for less. Whether you’re wishing you could find a way to reunite with friends, explore the far corners of the world or simply nab a break from the daily grind, we’ve got you covered. We’re your ticket to where you want (or end up being inspired) to go, without breaking the bank on flights – we make it possible for you to experience more. If you’ve hit us up on social media or replied to one of our email alerts, you’ll likely have heard from one of the team.
```

[Jacksflightclub](https://jacksflightclub.com) works as a mailinglist. They're constantly searching for good deals, and then found, they send out mailings informing their subscribers about those deals. You will only receive deals that are relevant to your physical location. For example, I am currently based in the Netherlands, so I will only get tickets leaving from the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.

The e-mail contains information about the deals and an instruction on how to book them. Jack isn't earning anything from you booking a ticket. Instead of working with some affiliate link, they simply provide you a direct link to Google Flights, Momondo and Skyscanner. It's all up to you on how you want to book. 

## Premium service

Jacksflightclub is a free service. Or, well, you can use their freemium subscription. The free version only sends a few notifications per month, and you do not get the best deals. It's great to try it out, but I can attest to the superiority of the premium version. And, at a mere 40 euro per year, you will return on your investment with buying just a single intercontinental ticket. 

```
It depends on how many insanely cheap flights we unearth. We don’t take commissions for your clicks and are not affiliated with any airlines or bookings agents, so we’ll only send you a deal when there is a genuinely fantastic fare. On average, free members can expect 6-8 awesome deals per month. Premium Membership subscribers will receive 25-40+ email alerts every month, depending on their departure airport selection.
```


## What kind of deals can I expect? 

Jack isn't just searching for cheap tickets, he also understands that some tickets are better than others. It doesn't make much sense to have a return ticket on the same day for instance. And, not unimportant, all of the deals I received have checked out to be completely legit. 

All deals are return tickets but you cannot predict what the destinations will be. Sometimes they're within Europe and sometimes outside. Some deals are financially more attractive than others but a few times I have seen more than 50% "discount" on the regular price. Cool huh? 

Another cool feature, is that Jack will sometimes send the "Weekend special". This is a mailing specifically targeted to people who like to take a weekend-break.

I have been a member for less then a month now, and I have received countless offers already. Some of the best deals I've received: <br /><br />

- Amsterdam to Manilla for __385 &euro;__ instead of the regular __700 &euro;__
- Frankfurt to San Fransico and then to Honolul for __530 &euro;__ instead of __1000+ &euro;__
- Amsterdam to Lima for __352 &euro;__ instead of the standard fare of __800 &euro;__
- Brussels to Tanzania for __393 &euro;__ instead of __800 &euro;__
- Brussels to Jordan for __77 &euro;__ instead of the normal __350 &euro;__

And many more...

## Give it a try

So, if you are flexible and you like a little adventure? Then I definitely recommend subscribing to this service. You can start with the free version which will give you one update per week. But if you really want to find amazing deals, pay the 40 euro for a year. If you just book one intercontinental flight, you will have returned your investment!
