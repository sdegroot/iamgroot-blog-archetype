Exciting! Finally I am ready to take the next step. I've sorted out the things I needed and started a business that allows me to begin my freelance work. The time has come to find my first assignment and with that, start my first adventure as digital nomad.

<!--more-->

Almost everyone I talk to about what I am planning to do, is super enthousiastic. Usually their response is something like: wow I wish I could that, this is really something for you or they're simply impressed with the apparent "courage" needed to take this step. And well, I guess you do need a little bit of courage to actually take the step. But in the end, what is the big deal? It is just another way of living your life. The only difference is, that it is not a very common way of living your life. Besides, if it doesn't work out, then I can always go back to my "regular" life.

Regardless, this step definitely exictes me. The biggest reason for this is the "great unknown". At the time of writing I barely finished with sorting my stuff at out home. I have no idea where I will be heading or what kind of project/assignment I will be working on. Just taking it step by step, seeing what is coming my way feels as if it is the right approach. It keeps things interesting and it also allows for flexibility. I am not yet booking any ticket whatsoever. 

The next step that I am going to take is to find my first assignment. Preferably, I leave the Netherlands with some level of certainty. I'm not looking for much certainty, but it would be really nice if I could start this next adventure with at least something. If I would not, I would be taking potentially too many things at the same time. Just imagine, just arriving in e.g. a Spanish speaking country, without a source of income, without knowning anyone and no idea where to start. I guess, it could work out well, and if I had too, I would do it this way. Luckily, I have the freedom to choose to stay a little longer in the Netherlands and make sure that I have taken care of one of those uncertain factors.

Up until today I haven't put much effort into finding an assignment or project. On LinkedIn I am replying to the recruiters' inquiries or job offers by explaining my situation. Unfortunately, up until so far, none of them have a contract that would allow working remotely. I guess this is to be expected, as working fully remotely isn't something that is very common in the Netherlands (yet). This picture is also confirmed by some of my (aspiring) colleague digital nomads. But I am not giving up on this yet, because I do know of some startups in the Netherlands that work remotely. And besides, I do believe that working remotely should be given more credit, as in many cases it could be a viable and cheap solution for companies. _On this last subject I will write a new blog post very soon!_

Now the time has come for me to actively start looking for an assignment/project. I prefer not to work on platforms like Upwork, for many reasons. But the primary reason is that I know what kind of quality work I want to deliver and I do not wish (or am able to) to compete with companies in Bangladesh and India that deliver not even half the quality but are ridiculously cheaper than I am.

Anyway, if you have or know of a company that is looking for a software engineer and that allows for remote work, then please send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sdg91/) or an email to <mailto:sdegroot@lovetoautomate.it>. 

The kind of assignment/project that would suit very well, would be related to these technologies:

- Java
- Spring (Boot)
- Kotlin
- VueJS
- API Development
- Continuous delivery
- Micro services
- Event driven architecture
