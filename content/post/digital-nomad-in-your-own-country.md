More than a quarter has passed and so much has happened. 
However, against all plans and expectations, I haven't left the country yet. 
Instead, I decided to start my digital nomad lifestyle in my own country, because well, why not? 

<!--more-->

Truth be told, starting the digital nomad lifestyle in the Netherlands was not really what I imagined when I wrote my previous blog posts.
But if have learned anything in 2018, it is that you can't plan life and it's usually best to follow where life leads you.  

## Starting the life 
In October 2018 life lead me to an assignment at [Backbase](https://www.backbse.com). 
I had been trying to get a remote job for a while but not booking any progress. 
Apparently, Dutch companies (or at least the ones in my network) are not very keen on the digital nomad lifestyle. - _I won't go into 
details here because I could write a whole article about [this issue](https://lovetoautomate.it/2018/09/my-thoughts-on-working-remotely/)._ 

At one point, I realized that I didn't have to start my adventure abroad. Why not live the lifestyle in my own country? 
Well, there was one concession to be made: I still had to go to the office. I can almost hear you screaming now: but but but, as a digital nomad you don't go to an office right?
If you were thinking this, you make a good point. However, if I were to go abroad, I would still go to coworking spaces. So at this point I really wonder what's the difference?
I guess, digital nomads usually don't stick too long in a single place. This is generally true, however, if you want to get some real work done, even digital nomads can't be on the road constantly.

So, even though I can't really call myself a ["real" digital nomad](https://www.digitalnomadsoul.com/what-is-a-digital-nomad/), I see my actions as a step in the right direction. 
By the way, I am in no way obliged to sleep in the same place constantly right? Like a proper digital nomad, I don't want to be tight to a single place.
This is why I created a business and purely freelance now. But I apply the same principle to my accomodation. 
I search for short term rental contracts in the most awesome locations. Because, well, if you are going to do it, please do it well! 

## My first apartment

So after I signed my contract, I started looking for apartments in Amsterdam. Whoever said it is difficult to find apartments in Amsterdam,  ~~was lying~~ _definitely knows what they're talking about_!
Luckily, I can be like a dog with a bone. So, let's call all the realtors that I can find and stalk them for short term renting contracts.
Within a couple of days I kind of won the housing lottery. Someone decided to go abroad during the exact same period as my contract at Backbase! 
And best of all, this apartment is located 10 minutes or less of cycling from literally every important place in Amsterdam! (Work, Leidsche plein, Rembrandt Plein and the Red Light District ;-))

This apartment is truly amazing. To respect the privacy of the owner, I won't post any pictures but trust me, it was great.

## Contract renewal

Initially, the idea was to work at Backbase for three months and this way, have some more time to find a company that wouldn't mind my digital nomad lifestyle. 
So, eh, plans change right? Yep. After 2,5 months I was offered a renewal and yes I accepted. 
This is one of those strange things. You can travel for months and "not doing anything" but once you get back to work, you get sucked into that life so quickly! 
It's truly amazing how this works. I guess it's partially due to my interal drive to perform and make cool stuff.
I simply couldn't get myself to leave Backbase after just three months. 
It was simply impossible to complete my assignment in three months and I hate to deliver unfinished work. So, why not renew?

Unfortunately, Backbase wasn't really into the remote working idea too much. But honestly, I didn't really try to convince them either.
I _liked_ the office again. Strange huh? Nah, I never really had any problem with going to an office. 
I just __think__ I prefer the freedom of working anywhere. But honestly, I have no idea if I actually like it. I guess there is only one way to find out?

## Life on a boat

I don't particularly fancy living on the streets and as the landlord asked me to kindly remove myself from the premises, I started looking for a new place.
Briefly considered moving into hostels, like I would abroad. But honestly, hostels are crappy in Amsterdam. And even worse, they're almost as expensive as renting an apartment!
who chooses to go and live in a shitty hostel if you can live in your own apartment for not much more? That would be me! Just not in Amsterdam...

The whole point of the whole digital nomad thing for me, is the adventure. So, it's time to find an even cooler place to stay.
And as luck would have it, there is a freaking houseboat available for short term rental! 
I never imaged living on a boat, let alone in the city center of Amsterdam (5 minutes from Amsterdam Central).

Just look at this:

<div style="clear: both;"></div> 

As you can see, it's super luxurious. And the location is even more central than my current apartment.
The boat is for sale, so I am allowed to stay until it is sold. That should be at least a couple of months, awesome huh! 
Anyway, I can't say much about the experience yet as I will be moving in tomorrow... So more on this later.

By the way, suddenly, I have a lot of friends who would love to come to Amsterdam. I don't understand the sudden interest, not at all ;-).

## Life in Amsterdam

Life in Amsterdam is not only about the practical things. I have to say, in the past I used to say: "I will never live in Amsterdam". 
Well, obviously I was wrong. But more importantly, I wrongly judged Amsterdam based on assumptions. It is so much better than I imagined. 
Amsterdam is a clean, beautiful city with so so so many things going on! 
Honestly, the only thing I don't like about Amsterdam, is the overload of tourists in the city center. This is why I usually avoid the city center.
But from tomorrow on, that is going to be a little more difficult haha.

At some point I decided to look for something to do on a random Saturday. I used Facebook to see what events were happening at that specific Saturday.
Men, it's a pity that Facebook doesn't provide a count of the events. The list just never ended, I simply could be scrolling for minutes without reaching the list end.
After having lived in smaller town most of my life, I now realise that having so much entertainment available at maybe 10 minutes cycling, is the best.

I am not going to bore you with all things I have tried. But I will tell you that I am keeping my word: try as many different new things as you can! 
    

## What's in 2019?

2018 was a great year in which I experienced so many things both personally and professionally. 
I am sure 2019 will be very similar but still so very much different. 
For once, I am not going to say what's going to happen because I would be completely off anyway!
