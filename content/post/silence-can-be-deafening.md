It’s 6 PM, it’s pitch dark outside and I’m all alone in my campervan. I have parked in a free camping spot near a swamp about 150km land inward. There’s nobody here except me and a some animals. I can’t see them but I know they’re there. I can tell, because, every once in a while some animal makes a screeching noise outside. However, most of the time, I hear nothing, nothing at all; complete silence. It’s somewhat disturbing really.

This is my first time being alone like this in the middle of nowhere. No cell reception and no one to talk to. It’s a strange feeling, being completely on your own. All kinds of things cross your mind: what if the engine doesn’t want to start tomorrow? What if someone comes to rob me here? I am just happy that I am in a van, and not in a tent because the winter is actually quite cold high up in the mountains of New South Wales.

I didn’t park my campervan properly. It’s tilted a little to the left and I know this will not be comfortable while sleeping. But to be honest, I am not liking the prospect of changing the van’s position. Maybe it’s because it is that pitch dark? Honestly, even looking outside scares me a little. Writing this gives me something to focus my attention on. 

As I realise it’s only 18:20 now, I still have about 3-4 hours before I can get to sleep. What will I do in this time? I have got some video’s on my computer that I can watch. Or I could write a little more about my experiences so far? Or maybe I will finally start working on the product that I have been talking about for the last six months… Probably not. Hehe. 

One thing I think I must do, is to plan what I am going to do tomorrow. If the weather report that I saw this morning is true, then it will be my first sunny day in the campervan. I have to make good use of this! Besides, as I am driving in the countryside now, I need to make sure I sill get back to the coast on Thursday night as then my three day surf course will start!

Oh, well,  I ended up moving the campervan as I had to get to the toilet anyway. And wow when I got out I saw one of the best views of the stars I have ever seen. The clouds apparently have all moved way in preparation for the sunny day tomorrow, so that is good! I did hear a couple of animals moving in the forest, that was quite scary to be honest. Luckily there is no bears in Australia (or is there?). So after watching a few TV series I decided to just lay down and watch the stars from my side window. What a way to fall a sleep, don’t you think?

For now I’ve set my alarm to 06:00 AM. Hopefully it will be almost light by then. This way I can explore the area a little more before I leave it again. 

Good night.
