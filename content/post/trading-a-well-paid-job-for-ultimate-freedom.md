Sometimes you have to make a decision in your life that goes against everything you ever learned. Recently I made such a decision by quitting my job and buying a ticket to the other side of the world. 
And now the adventure begins...

<!--more-->

## Realization

It's a Tuesday morning around 07:15 AM in the train to work. I realize that I only have 13 workdays left before my big adventure begins. It feels a bit strange as my life is about to change drastically. I started my professional career officially in 2012 but I practically started working in the IT industry way before that (2008). So for the last six years my life consisted of _at least_ (yes I am sort of a workaholic) 40 hour workweeks, architecting and developing (new) software products. 

In the last couple of years, I noticed that my life became more and more socially conformant. Everyday getting up at the same time, commuting to work, doing your job, having dinner and going to bed early. Of course, the weekends were still filled with lots of activities. However, if you make up the accounts, you're spending at least 70% of your life in such a way so that you can do what society wants you to do.

Now, don't get me wrong, I really *love* my job. I can't explain what it is, but I am just very enthusiastic when it comes to technology and automation. And there is also nothing wrong with being socially conformant. Personally however, I believe that it is of outmost importance to live *now*. You never know what will happen, so I choose to enjoy my life as much as I can, as long as I can.

Other people choose to work as hard as they can in their 20's, 30's and 40's so that they (maybe) can have easy lives when they're in their 50's on. Personally, I believe that my 20's are the best years of my own life. Very little responsibility (in your private life), learning to stand on your own and most importantly your health is more or less at it's peak. Why not take advantage of it while you can? It would be amazing to be able to tell my (future) children about my adventures when I was younger. I would hate it if I would have to tell them that I regretted not doing something and that I am no longer able to do so. 

I recall my parents telling me that high school is the most relaxed time of most people's lives and that I should make the most of it. Well guess what, I didn't believe them. Boy, what was I wrong. So, let's not make the same mistake again! Because who's to say I am still able to do everything I want when (or even _if_) I reach the age of 50?

So nice words and all, but I hear you ask, what about the last six years? Hah, good question. I guess it's a case of not taking your own advice. Do I regret these last six years? Not at all. Will I do something about it now I've realized? **Definitely!**

## Taking action
People close to me will tell you that I love to travel and meet new people. I only discovered the wonder of travelling a couple of years ago but since then it has become a bit of an addiction. So much so that I conceived the idea of _really_ travelling myself by going on a 6+ month journey. I mean, up to today my longest journey was about three weeks (excluding my six month internship in China). During my journeys so far, I've met so many people on sabbatical, gap year or work-travel and they all seemed very happy to have made the decision to do so.

In the last 1-2 years I have been playing with the idea of doing a trip like this myself. I needed some time to get used to the idea and of course to raise the guts to actually do it. It was November 2017 when I told myself: Sander, there is no better time than now. Not that it was actually a good time, because there is never a good time for something like this. I mean, I just recently started this great new job as a Lead Developer at [Caple](https://caple.eu)... We were just at the stage of preparing the launch of the product. I couldn't let Caple down right? Or at least that is how I felt about it. After some careful deliberation with some trustees, I decided to *just do it*. 

**So I quit!**

And no, this wasn't an ideal situation for my employer. However, I think they really understood why I wanted to do this and why I had to do it now. I am really grateful for how supportive they've been in making this decision. Especially because it wasn't in their own interest (or so I like to believe, haha). This kind of support needs to work two ways of course, so I decided to stay until the end of February so that I could still help them launch the product. In the end I think we found a way that worked for both of us.

## So now what?

_I have no idea_. And frankly, that is the whole point! 

For once in my life, I am not planning what will happen. There's just this idea of travelling the world. And to enable this I quit my job. Without a job, I do not have any ties or responsibilities and simply can go my own way. There is not even an enddate set to my journey! In my mind, my journey will last about six months. But if it, for some reason, becomes 7, 8, 10 or just 3 months, then so be it! 

Wow! just writing this makes me feel completely completely free of restrictions. Awesome. Granted, no restrictions is maybe a bit too optimistic. Money doesn't appear out of thin air afterall... Nor do I have a rich uncle that likes to sponsor me in this endeavour. Haha. 

Anyway, I bought my first ticket to Christchurch with a one-week stopover in Singapore!

For the foreseeable future I'll be mostly writing posts about my personal experiences during this journey!
