+++

I was asked to give a talk on *Event Driven Architectures* at [Landelijk Architectuur Congres](http://www.laccongres.nl/).
 This Dutch conference was hosted in _'s Hertogenbosch_ on November 17th-18th 2016.

The talk explains in more detail on how Twyp's architecture is based on the reactive manifesto.
During this presentation I am explaining how Twyp is architected and what we've learned in over two years of development.

Unfortunately the talk was not recorded. But you can find the slides on [SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/SanderdeGroot3/twyp-an-event-driven-architecture-in-a-fast-growing-ecosystem).
