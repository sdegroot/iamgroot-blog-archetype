Working remotely. This is one of those subjects on which there is a thousand different opinions. And seeing I am planning to make a life as a digital nomad, I have thought quite a bit about this subject myself. In the past I have interviewed people and put together teams. I've always been a strong advocate of having an on-site location. The past year I have realized and seen that it's a mistake to assume it's always the best way or that having remote working developers doesn't work.

Disclaimer: As a digital nomad, I am biased towards working remote. It is in my own interest to have more companies allowing remote work. However, my only goal of this article is to activate people to think about what remote work actually entails. I do not expect you to change your mind about the subject, I only ask you to think about the subject and try to put aside any preconceptions you may have.

## Relevation

Since I have been a software engineer, I have always felt that it was key for a project to have all the team members in the same room. Having the team in the same physical room results into more communication, better teamspirit and quicker problem resolution. This idea was strengthened by everyone around me confirming this preconception. In truth, I have never really worked in a remotely operating team before, so who am I to say that one works better than the other? My arguments usually were based on my experiences of one or two people in the team working part-time or part-time from home. 

While traveling, I have met quite a few digital nomads that have been working remotely for many years. In my in-depth talks with these interesting people, have given me a whole different perspective. This, combined with quite a lot of research on the internet, have made me realize that remote working is not as destructive to projects as I originally assumed. Even more so, it may have convinced me that remote work may (in certain cases) even be better for both employees ánd the companies themselves. However, having distributed teams does require quite a bit of change in structure and processes of traditional organisations with on-site teams. It's not as easy as making the decision and turning a switch.

## Pioneers

There's more and more companies operating with their employees working either fully or partially remote. Some of these companies even have a vast geographical distribution, e.g. some of their employees working in America while others are working in Asia, Africa, Europe or Australia. It seems the United States is one of the pioneering countries when it comes to remote work, as most companies originate from that country.

In my search for my first assignment, I found [remotive.io](https://remotive.io). This site, an initiative by [Rodolphe Dutel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodolphedutel/), helps remote workers on their quest to find remote jobs. They've created an extensive list of companies that not only allow remote work, but are also _currently hiring_. You can find this sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TLJSlNxCbwRNxy14Toe1PYwbCTY7h0CNHeer9J0VRzE/edit#gid=1279011369). 

Remotive is just one of the many examples why I want to move into the digital nomad world. Everyone seems to be eager to help each other, and in may ways make everyones life that much better. Unfortunately, only a few of the companies listed is Dutch. This is where the problem for me personally cones in. I like to make it a little more challenging by focussing on the Dutch market first. 

## Why allow working remote?

 I believe, in order to truly grasp something, you need to have the answers to questions like "why?" and "how?". So, it's important to understand what motivates certain companies to allow or even standardise working remotely. Though remote work is definitely not for every comany, there's many reasons why remote work is a blessing for other companies. 

### Bigger pool of fish

The fact is, there is [a major shortage of skilled software engineers all over the world](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/really-shortage-software-engineers-amit-patel/). So, say you're a company, and you're looking for building a highly skilled team of software engineers, what's the easiest way? Fishing in your local pool or widening the pool to the whole world?

I guess it depends on how big your local market is. But for many companies it is becoming more and more difficult to attract talent. While at the same time, talent is getting more mobile by the day.

### Less office space

Your developers are working from places all over (the world). Some choose to work from home, some prefer working in a coworking space and others work in cafés. It really depends on the personal preference of the employee on where he/she has the best working efficiency. 

Ofcourse this doesn't mean that you do not have a need for office space anymore. There are companies that work completely remotely, but in practise most companies still have the need for an office. This is especially true for bigger/corporate companies. Personally, I don't think the world is ready for all companies to work fully remote. Nor do I think it would be good; I'd liked to avoid scenario's like in the movies [Surrogates](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0986263/) or even [the Matrix](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/). 

### Higher productivity

The two previous points are kind of nice to haves but not the most important advantage. There is something much better that can be gained by allowing remote work. According to some studies and experiments<sup>[[1]](https://phys.org/news/2018-02-home-happier-youre.html)[[2]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/2016/05/02/are-remote-workers-happier-and-more-productive-new-survey-offers-answers/#51c905646663)[[3]](https://open.buffer.com/state-remote-work-2018/)[[4]](https://remote.co/how-working-from-home-makes-people-happier/)</sup> remote work can be beneficial for the employee happiness. And employee happiness usually leads to higher productivity [[1]](http://fortune.com/2015/10/29/happy-productivity-work/).

A lot of people also experience office work as beig less productive. This is usually because they get easily distracted by their [colleagues](https://www.fastcompany.com/40419045/what-to-do-when-the-biggest-office-distraction-is-your-coworkers). Other reasons for loss of productivity include: noise of an open-office, visual pollution due to many people moving around [[1]](https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/science-just-proved-that-open-plan-offices-destroy-productivity.html) and many useless meetings. This last item is one of my own experiences. I will admit, it is more complicated to have a meeting with people virtually versus physically. However, one great benefit of this, is that people will be much more inclined to only have useful meetings. Useless meetings would even become more annoying if you'd have to do them virtually.

So by giving people more freedom by letting them work from any place they desire, has many benefits. However, there is also one major risk to take into account. Not everyone is capable of this level of autonomy. There is a need for discpline and self-direction.  

## Concerns 

Remote work is not something that works for every company. Having people working remote, requires companies to believe in the concept and also to take the necessary arrangements to make it viable. You can't just introduce remote work and expect it to magically work. There's quite a number of companies that did make it work with great success. Trello even wrote an extensive guide on [how to introduce remote work into your company](https://info.trello.com/hubfs/Trello-Embrace-Remote-Work-Ultimate-Guide.pdf).

### Important aspects

Working with remote employees requires you to tackle some important aspects of that way of working. These are

1. **Mindset.** It is key to hire people with the right mindset. People should be motivated intrinsically. This is not something new; every company prefers motivated employees. However, if you have remote workers, you'll need this that much more. So, when hiring people, you need to focus that much more on people's personality. When looking for personnel, these aspects are important to validate:
  - Discipline
  - Autonomy
  - Know-how
  - Maturity
  - Communicative skills
2. **Trust.** So you've hired the right people with the right mindset. Now it is of outmost importance that you trust them. Professionals hate it when they're micro managed. Besides, it is a lot more complicated to micro manage if you're dealing with remote workers. 
3. **Result matters.** In the end you hired an employee because he should do a particular job. If the employee gets the job done or better yet, outperforms expectations, then you shouldn't care so much on how he achives it. There is one exception to this rule though...
4. And that is **Collaboration**. Having your employees distributed will result into them having more difficultiy to collaborate. You can not have 20 employees in different places, all freewheeling. Especially in software development it is key for colleagues to work together. As a company you must promote collaboration and provide all the tools necessary for this. Key to enable collaboration is to have proper **infrastructure for communication**.
5. **Time-zones.** It's great if you allow your employees to work from anywhere in the world. However, if you have 5 people distributed over all timezones, you'll face complications in collabotation. Say, for example, you have people in: New Zealand _(GMT+12)_, India _(GMT+5:30)_, The Netherlands _(GMT+1)_, New York _(GMT-4)_ and San Francisco _(GMT-7)_. Setting a meeting would be extremely difficult if everyone would work regular working hours, as there is not a single moment where all timezones overlap. Actually, New Zealand would never have a chance of meeting someone from the Netherlands, just as India would never meet San Francisco. You'll need to prevent this from happening.

All of the above mentioned aspects can be managed. The most important takeaway from these concerns is that working remote isn't just a company switch you can turn on. As a company you will need to take measures and truly be willing to give it a chance. 

### The ghost employee

I can imagine, when companies want to try remote working, they'll assign one employee to start working remote. In most cases, this experiment will be doomed to fail for one reason:

```
- An unequal balance of power -
```

This is where one of the most biggest problems with the introduction of remote work surfaces. Imagine, you have an autonomous team of 8 employees working on a single product. Of these employees, only one of them works permantently from home while the others work at the office. What will happen here? Most of the times, the one employee working from home will become some kind of a _ghost employee_. 

The seven employees at the office see each other everyday. It is much easier for them to quickly communicate something to each other verbally rather than via some digital means. This means, the one remote worker will miss out on this. A lot of communication at the office is usually noise anyway, but at times there are constructive discussions going on. During these discussions, the one remote worker is at a severe disadvantage. Remote communication is by definition more difficult than face-to-face. So, even if he gets included in the discussion at all, he has way less influence over any decision. 

Based on this argument, you could decide not to proceed with such an experiment. However, I would encourage you resist this urge, and simply take a different approach. You could, for example, start by having the whole team working remote for one day a week. This will put everyone in the same position, and will not have a major impact immediately. It will, however, allow you to measure what it does to productivity. 

## Why work remote?

Now we've covered the business side of things, let's a have a look at why you, as employee, would want to work remote. I don't believe there is a single truth to whether or not working remote is good for you. It greatly depends on the person, their character and personal situation. 

Some people will tell you they thrive better by working at the office. Their argument is usually because it provides a better separation of work and personal time. I agree on this subject if we are talking about working from home. But, forget not, working remote, doesn't force you to work from home. Personally, I really love co-working spaces. And before you will accuse me for trading one office for another: trust me, there is an enourmous difference between working at your employers office, or working at a co-working space. But, that is something for a different blog. 

Anyway, my point here, is that the preference for working remote is subjective. The last six years, I have worked at offices and I loved it. Honestly, I still wouldn't mind working at an office. But at the same time, I dream of the flexibility of working from anywhere in the world. Finding your space that inspires you the most and allows you to work most effectively. I recommend reading the book _Extreme Productivity_ by _Robert C. Frozen_ to read more about these ideas.

To answer the question of this section, I want to work remote because

- It will allow me to experience more of the world (as a digital nomad)
- I believe it will boost my productivity 
- It provides the flexibility I am looking for
- It will allow me to network more (as I will be staying in coliving and coworking spaces)
- (Almost) no commuting anymore

One very important thing I want to convey as well, is that in no way I am advocating that everyone should work remote, nor am I saying that I will never work in regular office anymore.
