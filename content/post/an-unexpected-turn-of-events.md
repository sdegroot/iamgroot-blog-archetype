Today I am almost 4,5 months into my journey and already flying back to the Netherlands. A lot has happened and I have made a couple of realizations that have made me (temporarily) come back sooner than planned.

<!--more-->

On the 5th of May 2018, I started my world travel without an end-date. Of course, I had some sort of an idea on how long I wanted to travel. In mind I thought it would be great to travel for about six months, the first half in New Zealand and Australia and the other half in South East Asia.

Today I am almost 4,5 months in and flying back to the Netherlands. Well, not exactly directly to the Netherlands. I found a cheap ticket from Denpasar (Bali) to Berlin and thought, well, I have never been to Berlin before so let’s do it! Besides, it’s really easy and cheap to take a night train from Berlin to the Netherlands.

But, before I go into the reason why I am heading back, I want to explain why I have not blogged so much on this blog after leaving. I know, it’s kind of a cliché: you promise to write a blog but in reality you don’t really do it. Actually, even though I haven’t written much here, I have been keeping another blog elsewhere. Before I left, I found this amazing app called Polarsteps. This app automatically tracks my movements and allows me to place photo’s and blog posts at the exact location it happened. I liked this so much that I decided to only write on this blog. I think it really gives a better impression of my travels then I could do it in any kind of blog.

## The need for goals

The last months have been an amazing experience. Travelling alone, making friends along the way and even meeting people from back home, it has been great. In every country I visited I had a completely different experience and each was good in their own way. Travelling like this, without any obligation and having the freedom to choose whenever and wherever I want to go has taught and brought me a lot.

One of the things I started realising after a couple of months though, is that I do like a little routine in my life. I like to achieve things, create new products and be busy overall. It took me quite a long time to get rid of the feeling that I had to make the most out of it (as in: don’t spill any moment, keep going). But finally, in Indonesia, I learned to let it go. So, by now I have learned to relax and do nothing for a bit. This doesn’t change that I prefer to have goals and actively work on those goals. 

Upon this realisation, I decided to start engaging in the digital nomad community. Especially in some Asian countries (like Indonesia) there is a big community of digital nomads. Digital nomads are people that can do their work from anywhere in the world. They only need a computer and a (good) WiFi connection. What a coincidence… In my line of work, all I need is exactly that! And as I really love to travel, why shouldn’t I try to combine the two?

## Digital nomad places

Places like Ubud and Canggu on Bali are hotspots for Digital Nomads. These places have good internet, all the facilities one could ever need and of course a great climate. Working and travelling at the same time also has downsides, one of those is that one can become lonely. Whereas while you’re just travelling, you constantly do fun things, once you start working, you won’t have as much time for fun things as before. Besides, if you want to get any work done, you can not be in a hostel. There is just too much distraction there. The result is, that you will have to find a quiet place where you can do your work. So you could rent an AirB&B and work from there. This would be a really quiet place, but then you don’t meet as many people anymore… Finding the right balance for yourself is key here.

It’s not a wonder that digital nomads seem to clutter together in a couple of places. These are all like minded people, in the same situation and with similar goals. It’s nice to share with others that understand your situation. The result of this cluttering together is that new businesses have sprout: co-working- and co-living spaces. The last month I have visited quite a number of these spaces, and I have found that I really love the concept and the vibe in most of those spaces. These spaces for me, have the right balance between serious work and fun. I can definitely see myself working in those places.  

## Other reasons to come back earlier

By now it must seem that I am kind of a workaholic and can't live without work. Well, I guess you wouldn't be far off. However, it is not really about the work itself. It is more about the need for mental stimulation than anything else. However, this is not the only reason why I cut my journey short. 

My original plan was to travel for about six months and then get back to work. As I left in March 2018, this plan would have me return in September 2018. September is already at the end of the summer, so I would be getting back in Autumn and therefore missing the best season of in the Netherlands. The shock of coming from spending months in tropical temperatures, back to the cold and rainy autumn weather is not something I would be looking forward to. So, why not come back earlier, spend a nice summer in the Netherlands while taking care of business and after that go back to the tropics?

Last but not least: I have my own place in the Netherlands that is currently costing my a lot of money every month. I need to turn this house into a profitable investment or just sell it. Just paying the mortgage every month without any revenue or staying there myself makes no sense.

So in short, I have many reasons to come back, but by no means am I planning to stick around for a longer time...

## Let's do it

The coming months are going to be very different from the previous ones. The biggest difference however is that I have a couple of goals that I want to achieve:

1. Set-up a business that will allow me to do international freelance (IT) work 
2. Find my first assignment as a digital nomad (freelance IT work)
3. Do some maintenance and construction in my house
4. Bootstrap my long time personal project (later more on this)
5. Get in touch with other digital nomads 

And of course I want to see all my friends/family and just have a good time! 

As you can see, I have a lot of plans and ideas. If there is one thing I've learned the last months is that plan *always* change, even outside of a work environment. So honestly, I have no idea what is going to happen. Will I succeed? And if so, will I like working as a digital nomad? No idea... but

**No risk no gain! And if you never try, you will never know.**
