While travelling is becoming more and more common, businesses are catching on to this new trend. Polarsteps is one of those companies that seems to have hit a gap in the market. Their app provides a really neat way of keeping a travel journal. I decided to give the product of this Dutch startup a go on a short trip to Wales...

## Why are travellers journalling?

In the past, if you were abroad, you would probably send post cards to your beloved ones. Postcards from all over the world informing others on your whereabouts and what you've experienced. Things go a little bit differently nowadays, as there's many more options to communicate with the home front.

**But why are we even doing this?**

*Disclaimer:  I can't say I've have done any scientific research on this subject. So the following is purely based on my opinions, experiences and some common sense.*

I believe there are a couple of reasons why people like to write about their travels

1. To keep people at home informed. For example your parents want to know what is going on. You could argue that you can tell them over the phone, but writing something allows to share the same story with multiple people and it allows to share photo's in the right context at the same time.
2. To help recall your experiences later on. Similar to a diary and just like a diary you do not need to publish the stories.
3. Attention from others. Social media is apparently [as good as sex](http://www.mydomaine.com/psychological-effect-of-social-media). I recommend watching the Black Mirror episode [Nosedive](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5497778/). 
4. Writing it off. For example my first blog post was mostly about me wanting to explain the world what I am off to do and why. It was not really to get attention (even though that was a nice benefit). It just allowed me to get rid of my thoughts about the subject and at the same time make it "official" and "definitive"
5. Can be used to fill times where you for example have to wait on a plane. I am writing this blog post on a plane myself.


## Finding the right tool for the job

![Polarsteps Logo](/images/travelling/polarsteps.png#floatright)

As I am about to go on a ~6 month travel myself, I did some research on what travel journal platforms there are. Originall I was simply planning to use this blog as the journalling platfor. Maybe I will end up using this blog anyway, but during my research I found a platform called [Polarsteps](http://polarsteps.com/). This platform surpised me quite a bit and so I decided to take it for a test run!

I think it's interesting to note that there are also quite a lot travellers who don't keep a blog. I've met several that only wrote down their experiences on a paper journal and others only make pictures to remember their experiences on. Personally I prefer to use digital means. After all, I am a software engineer for a reason ;-).

## The test run

On February 8th I flew for the weekend to Wales to visit [Megan](http://biodiversitea.blogspot.co.uk/) (who I met in Dublin a couple of months before). And because I believe that Megan is a great tour guide, I asked her if she would show me around in the north of Wales. Guess what? She did! And I took the oppertunity to test Polarsteps. 

Without reading too much about the app itself, I simply installed it and created my first trip "Wales Feb 2018".

- added some locations
- added photo's

The final result:
...

Really cool how it looks. ANd this time I haven't written any description to the places, but I am sure this feature works pretty neat as well.


## My findings during the test run

### Good things
- Very easy to use (also for people at home)
- Looks great
- Battery usage
- Simplicity
- Timeline approach
- Offline mode
- Integration with social media
- Gimmicks  like being able to follow other travellers, all kinds of statistics
- Smart Notifications 
- Being able to add stops in between on a later moment

### What would I like to see differently?
- The app is relatively slow on my iPhone 6S. Even with a high speed connection
- The webapp doesn't always work as it should
- Doesn't allow to integrate with other blogs (no RSS/current location)
- Locations are not always good, but this it the tradeoff for a better battery life
- I do not like that all of my photos  are analyzed. I wonder if they are uploaded as well?
- Offline mode could be a little better, you sometimes get errors that could've been avoided
- Login via Facebook required?
- Stopping the trip is weird? in my test i just wanted it to stop but it doesn't? due to the enddate

### Lessons learned
- You can only have one trip at a time. Keep in mind that your next trip can not start on the same day as your previous trip started

## Other concerns I had

- Do you need an internet connection all the time? No
- Does it also track your position if you do not have a trip started?



## Privacy

Polarsteps tracks your location constantly and Polarsteps also analyzes all of your photos to make suggestions about your trip. While both features are pretty cool and add value, they also cause privacy concerns.

Normally I am not really someone that reads all the privacy statements etc. But in this case was one of the exceptions. I don't want my photo's or location to be shared publicly unless I explicitly give permission for it. Another concern for me was copyright: the photo's I take are mine and should remain mine, even after uploading them to a public trip.

My general feeling about their privacy policy is that it is well written. They also seem to take the privacy of their users pretty serious. That being said, there are still a couple of clauses that you should be aware of:

### "The Services"
In the privacy policy they referen to something that's called `The Services`. It is not completely clear to me if these services are just Polarsteps or the involved data processors as well (e.g. advertisers). The definition can only be deduced: `and other data that Polarsteps gathers when you are accessing Polarsteps's Services. The Services are not available to individuals who are [...]`. I am going to assume that with `Services` the app and webapp is meant.

### Geolocated partners
```
When you visit to a particular location your visits may be shared with that location in order for it to better provide services to you. Additionally, brands may have access to aggregated and anonymous data, such as deidentified data about places that its followers visit (that is, not tied to individual users).
```


### Business partners

```
Our Partners: In addition to the data sharing described above, we may enter into relationships with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. You can easily recognize when one of these businesses is associated with your transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that business.
- Business Transfers: If Polarsteps or substantially all of its assets are acquired, or in the unlikely event that Polarsteps goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
- Protection of Polarsteps and Others: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law, including laws outside your country of residence; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Polarsteps, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations (including outside of your country of residence) for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
```

### Advertisements

```
Advertising - We may work with advertisers or other partners and advertising service providers to serve ads or services that may be relevant to you based on your inferred interests or location (or both)
```

### Hosting in the US
According to their Privacy Policy, Polarsteps uses servers located in the United States. After a quick check, it became clear that they're hosting their servers at Amazon (Ashburn). I am not sure why they (as a Dutch startup) chose to host their servers in the United States. Luckily your data should be secure as Amazon is compliant with the [EU-US Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome). 

Why should you care about this? The US are notorious for their screening on entering their soil. I have had friends that were interrogated (yes I would go as far as calling it interrogation) because they visited an African country. So if you are ever planning to visit the United States, be sure to have a good explanation on why you visited the Somalian desert ;-). I hope they won't make a fuss of me writing about this...



Problems
- There is no way to turn tracking completely off (except by deleting the app or turning tracking off in your preferences). You can however turn the level of detail lower.
- They do not describe what they're doing with the photo's you're not explicitly uploading (are these going to the server?)

Curious how they will handle GDPR requets. I will ask them to send me all the information they have on me.

## Gimmicks
- Gamification
- Statistics
  - How long you haven't travelled for
  - Furthest place from home
  - How many days you've travelled
  - How much you've seen of the world (in countries
- You can follow other travellers 


Feature requests?

## Travel books

This is how the company wants to make money. If they can make the books just as awesome as their app, then I may just use it. But I am doubting if this will work.. Maybe they can earn money in ...
