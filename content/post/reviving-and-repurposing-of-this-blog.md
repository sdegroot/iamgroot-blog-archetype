It's been almost a year since my last post. I've always wanted to write an active blog but I somehow never find the time or the energy to start writing. It's really a shame because writing usually really helps me with digesting my thoughts. Wether this is on a personal or on a professional level, writing helps me to think clearly.

I'm a fanatic reader of other peoples blogs, especially blogs related to my profession. The more I did this, the more I felt that I should return the favor to other people. And thus, I created this blog. Unfortunately it hasn't gone as I imagined. Being a bit of a perfectionist (ask anyone), I tend to want to share only about things I'm really knowledgable about. Just imaginging writing about a subject and then later finding out that I was incorrect makes me shiver. Funny enough, while writing this down I realize how foolish it is. I mean, everyone is allowed to make mistakes, right?

## Repurposing 

Well, enought of this rant. The reason why I am writing this blog post is because something big is going to happen in my life in March 2018. I will cover what this exactly is in a later post. But until then, I want to talk about the purpose of this blog. 

So far I have treated this blog (well, yes the two whole articles!) purely professional. I intend to change this, and this post marks the start of this new era. From today on, I will use this blog to write both about personal and professional experiences. The blog posts will be separated into two categories: 

1. Personal blogs (with the `personal` tag and/or in the category `Personal`)
2. Professional blogs (with the tag `technology` and/or in the category `Professional`)

In terms of content, my personal blogs will mostly be about travelling while my professional blogs will mostly be about technology.

## What I need to get of my mind

There is a couple of things I want to write down just to clear my mind regarding this subject.

* My English writing skills may not be up to par. *I don't care*
* People may not care about what I am writing. *So what?*
* I may not blog as much as I intend to. *Let's see what happens*
* Mixing a personal blog with professional blog is a bad idea. *Well, maintaining one blog is something, let alone having two.*
* People will judge me for what I am writing. *So be it.*

Life's too short to see bumps in the road up ahead.
