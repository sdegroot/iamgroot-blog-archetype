Most people in my profession will recognize the struggle. You're receiving several messages a day from recruiters. On one hand, this makes you very happy because it means that there is a lot of work and, you are wanted! Though, there is another side to this story: the recruiters. Some would call it a love-hate relationship. But, what is actually happening here? And can we maybe change it for the better? 

<!--more-->

Information Technology is everywhere. For one day, try to avoid all interaction with computer systems, this is next to impossible. Even if you put away your computer, phone, tablet, alarm clock and any other personal devices, you would still interact with a system probably at least every five minutes once. There is barely anything left that does not have a processor in it. I mean, think of these: traffic lights, trains, clocks, GPS, tapwater, central heating, your creditcard and there are so many more... (Smart) technology can sometimes be found in places where you wouldn't expect it. Examples are the light on your bike, your doorbell or even [your lighter](http://slighter.com/)!

This also means that there is an enormous demand for people who can build these systems... As a software engineer I feel like there is a surplus of jobs compared to the amount of skilled people. Of course, we have to take into account that not all jobs are created equal, neither are the people. And the more skills required for a certain job, the smaller the talent pool is.

Recruiters are dealing with this reality every day. They are hired by companies to fulfill job positions and of course these positions have to be filled as soon as possible. This puts quite a bit of pressure on recruiters. And to be honest, it doesn't really help that there is [more recruitment agencies out there then ever](https://www.recruitment-international.co.uk/blog/2018/05/recruitment-industry-edges-closer-to-40000-agency-mark). 

## "Anyone" can become a recruiter

A bold statement, maybe. But, honestly, there is quite a bit of truth to it. I am not saying that anyone can become a _good_  recruiter, but you do not need any specific education in order to learn the trade (or at least, how the trade is currently applied). In my experience recruiters usually have studied something completely unrelated to their field. Most of the times, they have some kind of background in psychology, sociology, human resource management or economics but I've already met my first Industrial Designer that turned to recruitment.

I guess this is mostly due to the strain on the market. It is ridiculously difficult to get (good) software engineers. Or DevOps / Architects / etc. for that matter.

## LinkedIn

As I said, many software engineers have a love-hate relationship with recruiters. Every developer I know says more or less the same. They are constantly "harassed" with cold-approach messages from random recruiters. Receiving the messages by itself is not necessarily the bad part; it is the contents of those messages. Countless received messages are for positions that are totally irrelevant to your particular skill set or do not fit your personal situation. 

![LinkedIn](/images/recruitment/linkedin.png#floatleft) 

That said, I totally understand that it is very difficult to know exactly what your prospective candidate is looking for. Most of the times you will have to make an educated guess. Unfortunately, the experience from the receiving end, is that most recruiters simply bulk send e-mails to profiles that match certain criteria on LinkedIn. Have you mentioned the word "DevOps" anywhere? Oh well, you must be looking for a DevOps job, right? Oh, now I come to think of it, "DevOps" is the thing where a developer works with business intelligence, right? - pun intended. The worst of all, is receiving an inquiry for a "Senior .NET Developer" position, when if you would have spent 1 minute on my profile, you would've realized I have exactly zero experience with .NET development. 

## Domain knowledge

Software engineers are a strange breed. They learned a craft at University (or using self-study) but their craft is actually "just" the tool. Software in itself doesn't add any value. There is almost always a business case behind software. Without this business case, there would be no reason to write any software. _Note that a business case doesn't need to be a profitable one, it can just be for learning exercise or personal efficiency._ 

![Understand](/images/recruitment/understand.jpg#floatright) 

What makes software engineers special, is that they always have to breath their craft but also deeply understand the business that they're working on. If you're a software engineer at a bank; you will need to understand mortgages, loans or any other of their products. You will not be very effective if you are simply a "[code monkey](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=code%20monkey)". In other words, software engineers need to really understand the domain. Besides, contrary to popular believes, any "good" software engineer also possesses good soft skills. After all, they're constantly working in teams and also working close to the "business people".

Now, if we have a look at recruiters. Many recruiters have no relevant education, -experience or even personal interest in the software engineering craft. Tell me, how is it that software engineers are expected to know everything and recruiters can "brush it off". I can't remember how many times I talked to recruiters that used terms like DevOps, Angular, Maven, Compiler, Scrum, JavaScript, etc. without actually knowing what they mean. 

So tell me, why don't we expect the same from recruiters as we do from software engineers?

## Big business

Apparently, the recruitment business is huge. There is a vast number of recruitment agencies and they just keep popping up more. I guess it isn't so strange if you take into account the amount of money involved. I have had agencies quote me 25% of gross salary when a candidate signed. Assuming a gross salary of 65k, the recruitment cost alone would be more than 16.000! And, this is not even taking into account that the cost a company has to make to do the proper interviewing rounds once a recruiter proposes a candidate.

![Stack of coins](/images/recruitment/coin-stack.jpg) 

Funnily enough, this 16k is **nothing** compared to what agencies can make off freelancers. I know of one guy who's rate is 100 euro an hour and the recruiter adds another 12 on top of this. This particular guy, is working on that contract for over 14 months. If you assume a month has about 140 billable hours on average, this totals the agency fee already over 23.000 euro. **And counting!**

And businesses are "happy" to pay for it. Crazy.

## Added value

The added value of recruiters is **connecting people with businesses**. That's it. This is especially true for some recruiters, as they simply act as a glorified search engine. But, even for the really good recruiters, their added value is in _connecting the right people with the right businesses_.

Unfortunately, in order to make as much profit as possible, recruitment agencies tend to optimize for quantity over quality. To connect the right people with the right businesses, you need to

- Understand the business
- Understand the position
- Understand the necessary qualifications
- Know the team dynamic 
- Know the needs of the potential candidate

Recruitment is not simply matching candidate profiles to hastily written open position descriptions. It requires thought, understanding, contextualization and most importantly knowledge of the candidates. 

![Connect people to businesses](/images/recruitment/connect.jpg) 

As a recruiter, you should not waste your clients time by sending CV's that are obviously not a good fit. In the ideal case, the first CV you send, is an immediate yes from both parties. And no, I do not mean this from a financial perspective. And now I come to think of it, you have actually two clients: the business and the candidate. You should treat them both with the respect they deserve.

## Another way

I didn't write this article just to rant about recruiters. Honestly, I am not bitter about it at all. I just always had the feeling that it must be possible to improve this situation. Especially because as a software developer, I love efficiency and even though it may be effective, I just do not see how the current situation is efficient.

If you are a recruiter yourself, you may feel that you are already doing better than how I am portraying your profession here. And you very well may be right. It is not about one recruiter, one recruitment agency, it is about the industry as a whole.

The biggest question I have been wondering is: 

```
Why aren't more software engineers moving into the recruitment business?
```

I mean, they have the necessary hard skills by definition. Usually, software engineers very quickly get a feeling if the peer they're talking to actually knows his shit, or not. Of course, you also need quite a bit of soft skills to determine if a candidate is suited for a specific job. And even though our profession might have the stereotype "nerd" lingering around.. not nearly every developer is like that. 

If I had to answer my own question, I guess it would be because software engineers want to develop software. Not search for and talk with people etc. And even though this will be true for most of them, I believe there is also quite a bit of untapped talent out there. That talent could be hugely beneficial to the recruitment industry. Or at least, that's what I think.

There is no doubt that there's already some guys doing this. I just haven't met them yet! 

## Approach

If I were to move in recruitment (who knows?) then I would have a couple of core principles. These principles are close to my personal values but they also make sense from a professional point of view.

I would say:

- You need to **keep in touch** with the software engineering trade. So become part-time recruiter or switch jobs between recruiting and development every ~ 1 year?
- **Network** is everything. And as a developer, it is easy to get to know other developers as you speak their language.
- **Learn about psychology.** Talking to people is an art, you need to perfect this. 
- **Quality above quantity.** Know the business, what they're looking for and understand your candidates!
- Do not become a glorified search engine. Have **respect for your clients' time**.
- **Transparency.** Keep your pricing and process transparent; avoid any bad feelings from any of your clients.
- **The candidate is as much your client as the paying business is.** Respect them.
- **Do not bother anyone.** Only relevant opportunities and only relevant candidates.
- **No expectations.** Candidates already get so many messages, just don't expect anything from them. They will appreciate it. 
- **Full service.** You match candidates with businesses, see it through all the way. You're not done when the candidate signed. You are just waiting for the next milestone: when the candidate leaves the company.

All of these together are not a recipe for success. I do believe that they will help you in your journey to become successful as a recruiter. Purely hypothetical speaking of course ;-).

## Data and tools

As software engineer you're uniquely qualified to create tools. Tools that can help you for your recruitment business. I know there is lots of tools out there, but they never really do exactly what you want. 

![Data dashboard](/images/recruitment/dashboard-data.jpg#floatright) 

So, given that you as a developer can make the tools you need, a whole new world of possibilities open. Suddenly, you can start collecting data and perform analysis on this data. I have so many questions that I would like to have answered. I mean, how long do people stay at any given job? Why did they leave? All of the questions you would usually ask in an exit-interview, are super relevant for recruitment. 

Basically, what I am saying, is: keep in touch. You are not done after a candidate signed. Signing is just one step of an indefinite process. Client retention could be more important than you realize. 

## Concluding

Business is booming. It's an employees market with very little talent but many jobs. Thus making it difficult for businesses to find candidates to fill their open positions. Recruiters have come calling to help connect them with the professionals. They seem to be effective because the number of recruitment agencies is rising rapidly. Effectiveness doesn't necessarily mean that they're efficient. Many of the recruiters have a non-technical background. In some ways, this cannot make it easy for them to operate in a world where there is so much technical jargon that even the professionals only know some of it.

It's strange that software engineers are expected to know their profession _and_ the business that they're working for, while many recruiters seem to get away with just searching and selecting on some terms without _really_ understanding what they're searching for.

What if, there would be more recruiters with a sound technical background? They would be able to much better select candidates, leaving less frustration for both the professional and the company. Because, if the recruiter would really understand the business, the team and the technology, he would be much more empowered to select the right professional. And for the business, such a recruiter, would save a lot of time spent on interviews, not to mention the decreased chance of "bad hires".

Anyway, I am sure recruitment is not easy. I am not saying that I would do any better, even with my knowledge on software engineering. What I am saying, is that **IT recruitment can probably be optimized much more** for both the company and the professional(s).
